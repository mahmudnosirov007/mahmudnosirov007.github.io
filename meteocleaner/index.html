                    <p><strong>METEOCLEANER</strong> is a space station which cleanses space junk in the orbit of the globe. Our station captures the space debris in its containers in which the junk is compressed and crushed. 
                        Afterwards, debris is thrown down to the Earth atmosphere and tiny grinded junks are burned during the entry beacuse of high temperature.<br/><br/> Space travel and exploration are vital for the future of humanity, however there are obstacles which complicate the case, like SPACE JUNKS. 
                        Debris are dangerous for the performance of future spacecrafts and satellites as well as the lives of astronauts in space stations. Even small piece of junk can heavily damage the spaceprobes. That's why we must resolve this issue.
                        </p><br/><br/>
                        <p>Meteocleaner can reduce the amount of space junk by crushing and throwing to the atmosphere which burns all the debris during the entry. 
                            First and foremost, the station collects the junk in 8 cylindric containers with dimensions of 8 metres diameter, 100 metres length each.<br/><br/> On top of them, 64 round lids are located with dimensions of 6 metres diameter, 6 metres height. They have covers which open to outside in each 64 lids. Inside the cylindric tube container, there are diapers which move from bottom to top in order to maintain the pressure to get the tiny junk particles out the container. 
                            There is oil to assist the diaper to throw the junk out with high pressure. The solar panels are situated alongside the probe to balance the energy and batteries to store the electricity. The main body of the probe is responsible for storing the oil. The control panel to control the process by which it is controlled directly from earth is located at the very bottom of the station.
